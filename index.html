                <h1>Son of India</h1>
                <p><b>Bhagat Singh</b> (28 September 1907 – 23 March 1931) was an Indian anti-colonial revolutionary, who
                    participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928[4] in what
                    was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist. He later took part in a largely
                    symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on
                    the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the
                    Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.
                    Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,the charismatic Singh electrified a growing
                    militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National
                    Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.</p>
